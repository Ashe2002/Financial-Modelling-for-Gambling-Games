# Financial-Modelling-for-Gambling-Games
In this project I explore two gambling games. One is based around a coin flip, whilst the other is a scratchcard lottery. I explore how to make nearly gaurenteed profit with the first game and for the second game I explore how to effectively implement the distribution of scratchcards and prize money.
